  <h1 class="title">Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>
  <h2 class="title-h2">TO LEON WERTH</h2>
  <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious
    reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even
    books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up.
    If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All
    grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication: </p>
  <h2 class="title-h2">TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h2>
  <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the
    primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the
    drawing.</p>
  <p>In the book it said: <i>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not
      able
      to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</i>
  </p>
  <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded
    in
    making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:

  </p>
  <p>But they answered: <i>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i></p>
  <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the
    grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that
    the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like
    this:</p>
  <p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the
    inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the
    age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure
    of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
    tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.  </p>
